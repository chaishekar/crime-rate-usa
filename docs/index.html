<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Taylor Swift, who needs no introduction, is a prolific American singer-songwriter, performer, and superstar. Her music has spanned genres, from country to electronic, and has accompanied many fans from daylight to midnight. Having won 12 Grammys and been nominated for 46, Swift’s accolades also reflect her prowess <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/taylor-swift/15450">Grammy</a>. In addition to Swift’s timeless music and strong fan base, Swift’s Eras tour in the summer of 2023 further catapulted her into a cultural phenomenon as she created and filled a blank space in pop culture. From an economic standpoint, Swift’s cultural phenomenon is intriguing. Swift’s Eras tour grossed nearly US$800 million with an average fan spending $1,279 per show <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/13/taylor-swift-eras-tour-money-jobs/">Bhattarai, 2023</a>. Furthermore, film ‘Eras Tour’ debuted at US$96 million in sales <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/10/15/taylor-swift-dominates-box-office-with-95-million-opening-for-eras-tour-film/?sh=70a0c9eb1801">Bohannon, 2023</a>. As self-proclaimed and aspiring Swifties, we cannot shake off our love for her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, this project aims to examine Taylor Swift’s music. By analyzing features of Taylor Swift’s music and public response to it, we hope to learn more about Swift’s cultural influence. We used the Spotify dataset, which includes metrics like danceability and valency that characterize each of Swift’s songs on the platform, and comments and submissions in the subreddit r/TaylorSwift, which provides insight into public response to Swift’s music.</p>

<h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
<p>To ensure the quality and suitability of our Reddit and Spotify data for analysis, we executed several crucial data preparation steps. Initially, we conducted a comprehensive review of each dataset, rectifying any data type discrepancies and addressing missing information while also verifying that there were no duplicate entries.</p>
<div style="text-align:right;">
<iframe src="./plots/nullValuesChart.html" width="750px" height="720px">
</iframe>
</div>
<p><font color="#D4E6F1">Figure 1: Handling Missing Values in Big Data: Making Informed Decisions</font></p>
<p>From the null bar plot of missing values, Figure 1 it’s evident that certain columns, such as ‘author_flair_css_class’ and ‘author_flair_text’, have a significant number of missing values. However, in the context of big data, dropping these columns outright might not be the most prudent decision.Additionally, we excluded the “is_submitter” column as it held minimal relevance to our engagement analysis. These strategic column exclusions led to a refined dataset consisting of 1,974,887 rows, finely tuned to meet our research objectives.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="image/hourly_activity.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
<p><font color="#D4E6F1">Table 3: Hourly Activity during weekdays and weekends, considering different hours of the day. </font></p>
<p>The summary table, Tabke 3 offers insights into the activity trends during weekdays and weekends, considering different hours of the day. Let’s break down the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hour_post:</strong> Indicates the specific hour when the activity took place.</li>
<li><strong>is_weekend:</strong> Binary indicator (0 or 1) denoting whether the activity happened on a weekend (1) or a weekday (0).</li>
<li><strong>Activity_x:</strong> Represents the total count of activities (comments or submissions) during the given hour and weekend status.</li>
<li><strong>Activity_y:</strong> Signifies the total count of activities at the specified hour, regardless of whether it’s a weekend or weekday.</li>
<li><strong>avg_activity:</strong> Reflects the average number of activities during the specified hour, factoring in both weekend and weekday occurrences.</li>
<li><strong>division:</strong> A constant value utilized for calculating the average activity, indicating whether it’s a weekday (5) or weekend (2).</li>
<li><strong>weekend:</strong> A categorical label classifying each row based on whether the activity happened on a weekday or weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this table provides a comprehensive view of hourly activity patterns during weekdays and weekends, shedding light on peak community engagement at different times throughout the week. The ‘avg_activity’ column ensures a fair comparison by considering total activity and dividing it by a constant, while the ‘weekend’ column categorizes each entry based on the day of the week.</p>
<p><img src="image/posts_table_comments_max.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><font color="#D4E6F1">Table 4: Top posts count of comments</font></p>
<p>The table 4 presents information on diverse post topics within the “/r/TaylorSwift” subreddit, offering a summary of key metrics related to comments on these posts.</p>
<p>Explanation of the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>posts:</strong> Identifies specific themes or subjects associated with each post.</li>
<li><strong>Activity:</strong> Indicates the quantity of comments on posts linked to each particular topic.</li>
<li><strong>sum_score:</strong> Reflects the overall score (upvotes minus downvotes) across all comments on posts related to each specific topic.</li>
<li><strong>sum_gild:</strong> Represents the total count of gilded comments (comments receiving Reddit Gold) on posts associated with each specific topic.</li>
<li><strong>sum_contro:</strong> Indicates the total count of controversial comments on posts related to each specific topic.</li>
<li><strong>permalink:</strong> Provides the permalink to the top post associated with each specific topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This table delivers insights into the engagement and reception of various topics within the subreddit. The ‘Activity’ column reveals the number of comments each topic garnered, while ‘sum_score’ offers an aggregated measure of the topic’s popularity based on comment scores. ‘sum_gild’ demonstrates the level of user appreciation through gilding, and ‘sum_contro’ highlights the occurrence of controversial comments within each topic. The ‘permalink’ column includes the link to the top post linked with each topic.</p>
<p><img src="image/posts_table_comments_contro.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><font color="#D4E6F1">Table 5: Top posts count of controversial comments</font></p>
<p>The summary table, Table 5 presents details about the top 20 posts based on the count of controversial comments. Each row corresponds to a post and includes information such as the comment count (‘Activity’), total score (‘sum_score’), total gilded comments (‘sum_gild’), total controversial comments (‘sum_contro’), and the permalink for each post. This table is valuable for identifying posts that have sparked significant discussion and controversy within the community.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the post named “midnights_leaks_discussion_only,” which has stirred considerable discussion and controversy. It boasts a high comment count (21,245), a substantial sum of scores (154,257), and highest number of controversial comments, positioning it among the top posts in terms of controversial engagement. The permalink for this post is <code>/r/TaylorSwift/comments/y7nfmf/midnights_leaks_discussion_only/j9504l1/</code>.</p>
<p>Concerning our Spotify data, we synchronized the temporal scope with our Reddit comments dataset, encompassing the period from 2021 to 2023. This temporal alignment allowed us to extract meaningful insights and explore temporal relationships, aligning seamlessly with our Reddit data that began in 2021.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we meticulously refined the Spotify dataset by selectively excluding certain columns to sharpen our analytical focus. Columns like “artist_id” and “artist_name” were omitted as they redundantly contained information about our primary subject, Taylor Swift. Similarly, “album_images” were considered non-essential, lacking direct relevance to our goal of understanding public reactions to Taylor Swift’s music. Furthermore, technical and URL-related columns such as “analysis_url” and “track_uri” were deliberately removed. These columns, while valuable in other contexts, did not align with our specific research aim of examining public perceptions of Taylor Swift’s music. This thoughtful column curation culminated in a final dataset comprising 194 rows and 23 columns, thoughtfully tailored to support our analytical endeavors.</p>

<h1>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
<p>Now that we have these important numbers, we can start making pictures and charts to better understand Taylor Swift’s music and Reddit comments.

Just like how numbers can tell us a lot, visualise can show us even more. So, get ready to explore and discover new things with our visual tools!</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the word cloud created from the comments. This will give us a good understanding of the comments.</p>

</div>
<p>The WordCloud (Figure 2) offers a fascinating glimpse into the language and topics that resonate most within the r/TaylorSwift community. It’s evident that Taylor Swift herself, represented by the prominent ‘Taylor,’ is a central figure in discussions. The frequent appearance of words like ‘think,’ ‘song,’ and ‘love’ underscores the passionate and thoughtful nature of the discussions, highlighting the emotional connection fans have with her music.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the noteworthy presence of ‘album’ suggests an active engagement with Taylor Swift’s discography, indicating that users often discuss and analyze her albums, contributing to a vibrant and dynamic community dialogue.</p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into the time series data of comments and submissions, enabling us to trace the evolution of engagement on Reddit over time. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the r/TaylorSwift community and how it has evolved over the course of its existence.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

<p><font color="#D4E6F1">Figure 3: Evolution of Reddit Engagement. A surge in submissions coincided with the release of ‘Taylor’s Version,’ followed by a substantial spike during the ‘Midnights’ album release. However, the ticket sales for the Eras tour led to an overwhelming volume of comments, highlighting the digital impact of Taylor Swift’s concert events.</font></p>
<p>From the time series plot (Figure 3), it’s evident that the Reddit community was already actively discussing the megastar. However, a noticeable surge in submissions occurred with the release of Taylor Swift’s ‘Taylor’s Version’ of her album ‘Red’.</p>
<p>This uptick in engagement was just the beginning. A substantial spike in both submissions and comments became apparent with the release of ‘Midnights,’ indicating a jubilant response from her fan base to the new album. Yet, this surge was dwarfed by the overwhelming activity observed when tickets for the Eras tour became available. The sheer volume of comments, reaching approximately 300k, surrounding the Eras tour ticket sales suggests a level of fervor that could have potentially strained the Reddit community, possibly even causing disruptions.</p>
<p>It’s intriguing to consider whether the intensity of discussions related to the tour tickets could have contributed to a notable impact, perhaps even leading to temporary outages on Reddit. This remarkable level of engagement implies that Taylor Swift’s concert events possess a seismic influence, not just metaphorically but potentially in the digital realm as well.</p>
<p>Now, armed with an understanding of comment evolution, let’s shift our focus to hourly activity, as detailed in Table 3.</p>
