<p>Crime is something we want to eradicate, but haven’t been able to. The purpose was to study the crime, crime rate and who is affected by the crime rate and how they are affected. The crime rate has decreased compared to 1900s, although we witness spike in crime rate post covid. I concluded that adults aged 25 and older have been victimized by the crime more frequently than younger individuals. I attempted to evaluate the elements that could be associated with the crimes and how victims could be selected. I collected the data for crime in the United States for crime type, age groupings of victims, gender, race. The second dataset contains information about offenders over time.</p>
<p>According to the raw data, Texas has the highest crime rate in the United States, with the majority of crimes occurring within the home. Assault crimes have been registered at a higher rate. A breach of drug abuse laws has also been committed.</p>
<p>Text data was collected on major crime hastags to understand people’s opinion on the ongoing crime in United States and also to understand what kind of crime people are having to face on everyday basis.</p>
<section id="naive-bayes-for-text-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-bayes-for-text-data">Naive Bayes for Text Data</h3>
<p>The Naive Bayes algorithm was applied to text data to classify tweets based on the FBI and USACrime hashtags, which were used to collect data and determine the significance of crime in the United States. The model was trained to categorize these tweets into their appropriate categories. This model achieved an accuracy of 96%, which is pretty accurate.</p>
</section>
<section id="svm-on-text-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="svm-on-text-data">SVM on Text Data</h3>
<p>SVM was applied on the text data with the same goal as Naive Bayes to classify the tweets, The models have an accuracy ranging from 96% to 99% for determining the category, which is considered to be quite high. The collection of terms enables the model to make predictions about tweets or classify them into distinct groups. Since they account for 99.9% of the variation, the linear model and RBF Kernel model provide the most accurate depictions of these data.</p>
</section>
<section id="clustering-on-text-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering-on-text-data">Clustering on Text data</h3>
<p>Clustering was performed on text data to discover similarities between the texts in tweets including the hashtags for CRIME; the resulting clusters were overlapping and thick, possibly due to the massive volume of data and the probability of similar phrases appearing in various tweets.</p>
</section>
<section id="naive-bayes-on-record-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-bayes-on-record-data">Naive Bayes on record data</h3>
<p>Homicide (murder and non-negligent manslaughter), rape, robbery, and major assault constitute violent crime, according to the records used by Naive Bayes. Violent crimes employ or threaten the use of physical force.</p>
<p>The data on the Crime Data Explorer only includes recorded incidents; it is not a comprehensive database of all crimes. Before analyzing the data, it is essential to comprehend the several causes of criminal behavior and crime reporting in a community. Existing data may be misleading in the absence of certain components. There are numerous factors to consider, including population size and density, the economy, the unemployment rate, the prosecutorial, judicial, and correctional policies, the administrative and investigative focus of law enforcement, how people feel about crime and police, and the actual strength of the police force.</p>
<p>The dataset includes three sorts of information regarding violent crime victims: their age, gender, and race, as well as the type of crime committed.</p>
<p>The state’s crime rate statistics include property and violent crime rates. For naive bayes, the violent crime rate is evaluated, which is further subdivided into categories such as murder, rape, robbery, and assault crime. The second set of data is comprised of hate crime statistics from 1990 through 2020.</p>
<p>The purpose of the naive Bayes study was to enhance the accuracy of victim age, victim race, victim gender, violent crime rate, and hate crime forecasts for each category, given the types of crimes committed. The model’s accuracy in predicting the relationship between age group and hate crimes is 60%, which is above average for this age group. The model’s accuracy in predicting gender and race is 75%, which is a reasonable accuracy for that gender and race group, however the model’s accuracy in forecasting violent crime from 1960 to 2019 is 93%, which is a rather high accuracy.</p>
</section>
<section id="decision-tree-on-record-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decision-tree-on-record-data">Decision Tree on Record data</h3>
<p>Decision tree was applied on the same data. The objective of this Decision Tree study was to classify age, race, and gender according to the types of violent crimes committed. After hyper-parametric tweaking, the model predicts age with an impressively high accuracy of 82%, gender with an accuracy of 88%, and race with an accuracy of 88%. The tuning graph is not shown because the model performs equally on both training and testing data, which are of modest size. The accuracy of the Violent category model is 97% due to the amount of the data, and the decision tree provides a great deal of explanation in comparison to the other datasets used.</p>
</section>
<section id="clustering-on-record-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering-on-record-data">Clustering on Record Data</h3>
<p>This information is obtained from an FBI source that tracks state-by-state crime statistics from 1960 to 2019. The data contains the property crime rate and the violent crime rate. However, we will focus primarily on the rate of violent crime because that was the basis for the decision tree analysis. Assault, rape, robbery, and murder are the four different sorts of violent crimes. The aim is to look for connections between the crimes. Clustering the dataset provided insights into that. The data clusters are overlapping and could be improved.</p>
</section>
<section id="arm-and-networking-on-record-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arm-and-networking-on-record-data">ARM and Networking on Record Data</h3>
<p>The primary objective is to find a quick way to summarize state record data from 1990 to 2019 using Networks. Networks provide a theoretical framework for conceptually representing interrelations in a wide variety of systems and discovering statistically significant interrelationships between variables in large databases. From the network graph, I could determine how different types of crimes and years are related with specific locations. When considering the two primary crime categories, the graphs indicate that there is a correlation with two distinct crime types, indicating that there is an association between each crime category.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that the rate of crime is increasing in all cultures around the world, but I personally feel that there is plenty that governments and individuals can do to reduce crime in communities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, governments can take a variety of significant steps to minimize or even eliminate various sorts of crime.</p>
<p>First, governments can deploy more police officers throughout the country to monitor people’s actions and prevent them from committing crimes. Second, the government can use new technologies like surveillance cameras in the streets, shopping malls, restaurants, and other public locations to deter thieves. Third, heavy punishments for offenders can have significant preventative and deterrent effects on all age groups in society, therefore by employing harsh penalties such as imprisonment, physical or financial punishments, the rate of crime can be reduced.</p>
<p>Individuals in society, on the other hand, can be of considerable assistance in reducing the amount of crimes committed. To my perspective, the vast majority of individuals tend to participate in activities that help the government keep society secure for their own families, others, and people of all ages. As an example, most people may play an important role in crime prevention by reporting problems to police. Furthermore, when citizens are concerned about reducing horrific crimes in cities, government can take preventive measures to improve the condition in society. To summarize, in order for a society to be a safe place to live, all members of society, including governments and citizens, must take the required steps to keep it crime-free.</p>
